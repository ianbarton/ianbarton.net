In my search for a new action camera I decided to buy the SJ Cam 8 Pro from
Amazon. The specifications looked good including optical image stabilization
and better battery life than its competitors. However, on the three cameras I
received from Amazon, the front display never worked on two and on the third it
failed after a couple of days.

I have heard that there have been problems with copies of the SJ Cam being
distributed. I have no idea if the three cameras I received were illegal copies
or not. The packaging and included accessories appeared to be genuine. Whatever
the reason, the three cameras I received were unreliable, so I decide not to
buy a camera made by SJ Cam again.
