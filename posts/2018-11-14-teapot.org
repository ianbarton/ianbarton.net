Most of our family enjoy loose leaf tea. In a retro moment my wife wanted a
"proper" teapot. This tea pot contains a stainless steel infuser, which keeps
the leaves and hot water separate. So when you pour out your tea, you don't end
up with a load of tea leaves in the bottom of the cup.

It seems well made and the infuser is easy to remove and clean. It's available
in a couple of different capacities and several colours.

Unlike certain other items the pink one is the same price as the other colours!
In fact it looks more orange to me (I didn't choose the colour).
