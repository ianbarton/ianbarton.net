As someone who can sleep almost anywhere and if the sheets are uncomfortable,
I'll just sleep on the floor or on top of the bed, I was deeply skeptical about
bamboo sheets. I thought bamboo, was only used for the sticks that hold up your
peas and beans:)

I have to admit that I was completely wrong to be so skeptical. They are very
comfortable, feeling much cooler than cotton in summer. Also,they feel much
"smoother" than cotton.
