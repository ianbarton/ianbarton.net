I learnt to ride a two wheeled bicycle when I was four and a half. Up until I
got a motorcycle licence I cycled everywhere, as it was the only way of
getting around. There followed a period of about 15 years when I did almost no
cycling. When I was about 30 I bought my first proper road bike with drop
handlebars and derailleur gears. This re-ignited my interest in cycling. I have
never been interested in cycle racing, other than watching it on TV. Almost all
of my cycling is either along, with a family member or a friend.
</p>

<p>
After my cancer operation in January 2017 I set myself a target of cycling at
least 100 miles per week to keep fit. I try to avoid cycling in the dark, as I
can't see the scenery. Now I am almost 64 I am much less tolerant of getting
wet, cold and muddy in the winter months. So I decided to by a Smart Trainer,
mainly for use in the winter.
</p>

<p>
Smart trainers come in many different configurations. However, they all have
the same basic principles. Your remove your back wheel and connect your bike to
a flywheel, which has a cassette that replaces the one attached to your rear
wheel. So you can use your gears as normal, but you will be turning a
flywheel. Most trainers have several built in sensors, which will tell you how
fast you would be moving if you were on the road, the amount of power being
transmitted through the pedals,the cadence (how fast your pedals are rotating)
and possibly your heart rate if you have a heart rate monitor. Most trainers
can connect to external devices either by bluetooth or Ant+.
</p>

<p>
The Smart part is being able to follow a route using an App connected to the
trainer and the amount of resistance in the flywheel is varied depending on the
angle of the road on your selected route. So the resistance in the pedals feels
exactly as it would if you were actually cycling the route.
</p>

<p>
There are a whole range of smartphone/computer apps that you can connect to
your smart trainer. Apps are broadly divided into two categories: dedicated
almost exclusively to training and apps that have Virtual Reality. In fact most
apps have quite a bit of crossover between categories. Two of the most popular
apps are Bkool and Zwift. See the link below on road.cc that gives a list of
almost all available apps.
</p>

<p>
Most apps will host races that you can participate in. However, my main
interest is simply cycling routes in distant parts of the world without having
to travel there. Bkool has a large library of routes from all over the world,
including all the famous alpine passes and many of the famous World Tour
routes. Most of the popular routes have video, or at least a 3D VR
representation of the route. I Chromecast the route from my phone to a 24"
monitor. Following a route that has video coverage is almost the same as
cycling in reality. You can also upload your own routes.
</p>

<p>
The majority of smart trainer apps require a monthly subscription, but you can
usually get a months free trial.

</p>

<p>
My trainer is permanently setup in the utility room (aka the Pain Cave). At the
moment the temperature inside is about 4C. However, after about 30min cycling I
am soaking wet from the sweat. Unlike cycling on the road there is no wind to
cool you. A good fan is mandatory and plenty of fluid! I usually listen to
podcasts via a bluetooth speaker.
