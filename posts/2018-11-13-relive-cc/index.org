At the moment this site is just a bit of fun, but I could see the idea being
developed into all sorts of interesting uses. At the moment it takes cycling
GPS tracks uploaded to Strava and turns them into a sort of flyover video. I
presume it uses Google Earth. If you have uploaded some photos with your track
it will pause at the relevant part of the track and show the photo.
