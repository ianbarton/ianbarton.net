PlanetX Merino Beanie. Price about Â£8 depending on style. Keeps your head and
ears nice and warm. Fairly water resistant, but not waterproof. As it's made of
Merino you can wear it for months and it will remain odour free. Wash at
30C. Mine survives he washing machine without shrinking, even though it's Merino
