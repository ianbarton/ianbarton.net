We live in an old farm house, with brick walls. When we were doing some
renovations about 10 years ago, I managed to run ethernet to most of the
rooms. This works if you have a desktop computer and don't mind having it
plugged into an ethernet socket. However, almost all the family exclusively use
devices that connect via WiFi. We got round the WiFi coverage problem by
installing routers in several parts of the house, with separate
SSID's. However, there are several parts of the house with poor coverage and
you have to remember to connect to the SSID that gives you the best coverage.

Enter the concept of mesh networks. There are several different companies
making mesh networks. The main reasons I chose Google are it's trivially easy
to configure and the app offers all sorts of performance monitoring. Like other
mesh networks you have a single SSID and the network automatically connects you
to the unit with the best performance in your location.

Initial setup involves trying out where the WiFi units should be placed. This
is where the app really shines. Not only does it tell you what the signal
strength is in any room, but you can see the upload and download speed for each
connected device. This makes it easy to move the access points around to give
optimal performance for everyone.

You can configure the network priority for each connected device to make sure
your children don't hog all the available bandwidth. You can setup groups of
devices, where you can control access to the network for the group. Useful to
turn off Internet access at bed time.

If you need to twiddle with various advanced network settings such as DNS
servers and port forwarding, you can do this via the app.

In summary: it just works out of the box, performance is good and it offers
lots of twiddling options if you need them.
