We have had a couple of Echo Dots and an Echo speaker for a couple of
years. However, we don't have any "Smart gadgets". Something to turn off the
lights would be useful, as other family members think that lights have an "On"
switch, but it has no "Off" function. However, all our switches are brass and
most of the bulbs are candles, for which there don't seem to be any aesthetically
pleasing smart versions.

However, we do have quite a few power strips with things like computer charging
bricks and TV's plugged in, which don't need to be powered up overnight. The
TECKIN WiFi Smart Plug works both with Alexa and Google Home (not tested as I
don't have a Google Home device). You can control the sockets either by using
Alexa, or via the app. The app also allows you to turn the sockets on and off
and depending on your Internet setup you can do this if you only have a mobile
connection. You can also set up schedules and timers for the plug.

So far they have been very reliable and easy to set up. My only concern is that
the Smart Life app does require quite a few permissions and wants to know your
location.
