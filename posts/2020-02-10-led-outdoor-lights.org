I bought a couple of these to illuminate outside areas where it would be
difficult to run a mains supply.

I have had these a couple of weeks. Illumination is good and they seem to be
well-constructed and are IP65 water resistant. Solar recharging seems to be
working, given the current short daylight hours and overcast sky.
