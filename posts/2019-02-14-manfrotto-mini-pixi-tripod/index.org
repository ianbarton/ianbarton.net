I have recently bought a Osmo Pocket and want to make some videos that require
the Osmo to be mounted on a tripod. I already have a Velbon full sized tripod, that
belonged to my father, which I could use. I want to use the Osmo on some
mountain walks and to record some climbing. In the past I have carted the
Velbon strapped to the outside of my rucksack, but the extra weight has put me
off taking it with me on a regular basis. I have also got a Gorilla Pod clone,
which is good on uneven ground, but isn't particularly stable.

There are lots of mini tripods available on Amazon, but I noticed the Manfrotto
Pixi was on sale for £12.50. Full sized Manfrotto tripods have a good
reputation, so I decided to purchase the Mini Pixi. The legs are non extendable
and have a small rubber pod at the ends of the feet that help to stop the
tripod sliding on slippy surfaces. When the legs are closed you can use the
tripod as a grip.

Like many other mini tripods there is a ball and socket joint that allows you
to tilt and pan the camera. To tilt and pan you press the small button and
rotate the head to the desired position than simply let the button go to lock
the head. This makes it much easier to adjust the position of the head
accurately unlike systems which require you to manually tighten a friction
joint.

I tried the tripod my Canon DSLR with a standard lens and it was stable, so it
should be OK with any compact camera or phone. It costs £19.50 on Amazon at the
moment, but I was lucky enough to pick it up in a flash sale for £12.70.
