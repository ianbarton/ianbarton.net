Platypus Water Bottles.  These aren't cheap, but if you shop around you can get
them for less than the prices you can find on Amazon. They are available in
various capacities and with different tops e.g. a straight screw on, or one
with a pull up drinker.

So why would you buy one, rather than just use a recycled bottled water
container? Their main usp is that they occupy almost no space when empty. They
are also very robust. My oldest one is about 5 years old and still going
strong. If you use a hydration drink tube inside a rucksack they are compatible
with all the common systems.

If I go camping I need about three litres of water for an overnight stop to
rehydrate meals and drink. I try and get water as close as possible to the
place I camp. If I used rigid containers they would be wasting 3 litres of
space inside my rucksack for most of the day.

When not in use, I roll them up and store in the freezer to stop fungal growth.
