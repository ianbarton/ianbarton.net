I swore that I would never buy a turbo trainer, as riding a bike inside is so
boring. However, after my recent operation I needed something to help me get
fit again. I had lost almost 2 stone, which as I was quite skinny to start with
meant that most of it was muscle.

I wasn't up to cycling on the road and although I was being taken for walks by
the dog twice a day, I needed something more energetic. Decathlon is a large
French sports retailer, with several shops in the UK. Their stuff is generally
of good quality and inexpensive.

I chose this turbo as it was the cheapest in the range, but had good
reviews. It folds flat when not in use, so is easy to store. It's also very
easy to "connect" to your bike and works with the three most common wheel
diameters.

I cycle for two 30min sessions per day and combined with walking it's helped
get me much fitter. I have solved the boredom problem by pinching my daughter's
music stand and using it for my android tablet. I can now happily watch Amazon
Videos and Netflix while I am peddling.

Yesterday, I did manage to get out on a proper road, but am starting six months
of chemotherapy next week, so suspect I'll be back on the turbo trainer soon!

If you like cycling, but don't like getting cold and wet in the winter it's
cheaper than going to the gym.
