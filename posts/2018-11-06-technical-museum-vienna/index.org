A Whatever Works Away Day at the Technical Museum in Vienna.
https://www.technischesmuseum.at/language/en-us/home

This is the best science museum I have ever visited. It focusses more on
technology than pure science. At the moment it doesn't have any exhibits of IT
tech, but major renovations are taking place.

However, if you want to know about how just about anything else works, this is
the place to go. It covers stuff from basic science (mass spectrometers, early
experiments to determine the atomic weight of molecules), to heavy
engineering. There is a Bessemer Converter, trains, machines for pressing
steel. The list is almost endless.

There is a very good children's section and lots of interactive machines to
demonstrate various physical principles. It's huge, so you need more than one
day if you want to explore it all.
