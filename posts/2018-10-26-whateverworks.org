I have been using Google+ for posts for some time. However, Google has
announced that G+ is going to be closed down for non GSuite users! I have been
one of the moderators for the WhateverWorks community, where I made many
posts. I have exported those from G+ and will now re-post them here. I'll link
the post to the original G+ one, so you can read the discussions relating to
them while G+ is still available.
