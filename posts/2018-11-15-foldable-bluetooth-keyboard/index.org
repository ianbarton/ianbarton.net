I have been looking for a foldable BT keyboard for a while. Almost of my
computer use consists of using Emacs, a terminal and the Chrome browser. Using
the Tmux terminal emulator app, I have got Emacs to work on my Fire tablet. A
7" screen is fine for writing and reading text. When I use Emacs, all my input
is via the keyboard, no mouse required. However, most Emacs functions use the
Ctrl and Alt keys in combination with another key (e.g. Ctrl-x-s for saving a
file), which is almost impossible using an on-screen keyboard.

This keyboard is robustly built, with a metal outer. The latching mechanism
looks as though it will withstand lots of abuse. The keys themselves have a
nice action and the spacing about the same size as my Dell XP notebook, so it's
nice to type on.

The keyboard folds down into a pocketable size. Now instead out taking my
expensive laptop out with me, I can achieve the same functionality with a cheap
Android tablet.
