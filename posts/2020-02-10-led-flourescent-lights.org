We have a lot of old fluorescent tubes in outside buildings. The fittings for
most of these are decades old and really need replacing. I have bought a couple
of these LED fittings to see if we can use them as replacements. The one linked
is a direct replacement for a 5ft tube.

They have a three-year warranty and subjectively the level of illumination is
much better than the equivalent tube. Claimed electricity consumption (not
checked yet) is less than the 90W tubes they are replacing. An important factor
if you have nearly a hundred of the old ones!

Unlike the old tubes, which struggle to start if they are old, or it's cold
these come on instantly.
