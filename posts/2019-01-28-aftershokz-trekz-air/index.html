    <p>
I am a regular cyclist and I like to listen to my podcasts while I am out. I
have been using a pair of Zolo Liberty wireless earphones for some time. They
are in ear buds and so isolate you from outside noise. I need to be able to
be aware of surrounding traffic, so I just use one of the ear buds when
cycling. The sound quality from the Zolos is good, but they have a battery life
of 2 to 2.5 hours. The case contains a rechargeable battery and can recharge
the buds quickly. Half an hours charging gives more than an hours battery
life. However, it can sometimes be a bit tricky to get the ear bugs to dock
with the magnetic pogo pins in the charger case. There is also a worry that the
ear bud might fall out of my ear while cycling. This has only happened twice,
both times on a quiet country lane, so I managed to grab the ear bud off the
road before it was run over.
</p>

<p>
Recently I read a short review by another cyclist saying that they were using
bone conduction ear phones. They deliver the sound through your cheek bones
leaving your ears completely free to hear outside sounds. They have a light
weight band that wraps round your head, making it very unlikely that they will
fall off. They are IP55 rated, so are OK to use in pouring rain and shouldn't be
affected by sweat. There are two noise cancelling microphones which exclude
background noise so people can hear what you are saying if you use them for
making and receiving phone calls.
</p>

<p>
I listen to podcasts almost exclusively when cycling and not music and sound
quality is good. I tried listening to some music tracks to evaluate their
performance. Whilst they can't compete with my Sony over ear noise cancelling
WH1000MX2, the sound was perfectly acceptable. Although I wouldn't usually use these
ear phones for watching videos, I tried them watching Netflix and YouTube and
lip sync was OK.
</p>

<p>
There are two models of the Aftershokz. The original titanium and the lighter
Trekz Air. In use they seem to be almost weightless (29.5g) and are comfortable to wear
for several hours. The Air offer several improvements over the original
Titanium:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Reduced sound leakage.</li>
<li>Improved dual noise cancelling mics.</li>
<li>New antenna for improved Bluetooth connection</li>
<li>Re-designed bone conduction transducers to deliver more bass</li>
</ul>
<p>
Price: definitely not cheap! Around £150 for the Air, although I got mine of
special offer for £99.
</p>

<p>
Controls: one side has a button that acts as a pause/play control and will
answer incoming phone calls. The bud on the opposite side has the micro usb
recharging socket, the power on/off button and volume controls.The volume
controls are small and difficult to operate. This isn't a problem for me as I
normally set the volume on my phone before setting off and don't usually need
to alter it. The controls will also allow to make and receive phone calls and
check the battery status. Apart from answering phone calls, the other functions
are difficult to control on small buttons hidden behind your ears.
</p>

<p>
Battery life: claimed to be 6hrs (not tested by me). About an hour and a half
to recharge, but 15 mins provides quite a boost. Recharging is via a micro usb
socket, rather than USB C.
</p>

<p>
There are voice prompts from "Audrey Says" to guide you through pairing and
using the headphones, but if you have ever used bluetooth headphones before
they are superfluous.
</p>

<p>
To summarise: these headphones are designed for a niche use. If you participate
in a sport where you need to be able to hear what's happening around you they
are excellent. For more mainstream users they are of limited appeal.
