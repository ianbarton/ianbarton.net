Does what it says on the bowl! Our Labrador puppy is a typical Lab. He doesn't
eat food, it just gets sucked straight out of the bowl in a few seconds. This
is a very simple idea. The bowl has lots of "fingers" on the bottom and the
biscuits drop into the spaces between the fingers. It now takes him a couple of
minutes, rather than a couple of seconds to eat his food. I wonder if it works
with greedy people too:)
