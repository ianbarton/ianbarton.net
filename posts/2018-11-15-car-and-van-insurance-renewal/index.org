Car/Van Insurance Renewal.  This week my insurance cover for the truck expires,
so I used GoCompare to get some quotes. The cheapest I found from Zenith was
about Â£100 less than the renewal from my current company (Admiral) for the same
level of cover.

Admiral have the annoying habit of using your debit card to auto-renew your
policy as a "Safety Measure" if you don't contact them to cancel the
renewal. So, I rang them up to make sure they didn't auto-renew my policy and
they somehow magically reduced their quoted renewal price to slightly less than
the Zenith quote.
