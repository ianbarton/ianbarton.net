I tend to wear my trainers to destruction. Recently, the soles of my feet have
been getting sore when walking and when wearing my cycling shoes. Part of this
is a side effect of last year's chemotherapy. However, when I looked at the
insoles of my shoes they were very worn.

There is a huge range of replacement insoles available. The manufacturer ones
for my cycling shoes cost around £40. I can buy a new pair of the same shoe for
only a small amount more! Brands like Superfeet are similarly expensive.

Recently, somebody recommended me to try these insoles. There are various
different versions, for different sorts of foot problem. I bought a pair of bog
standard ones and after a couple of days use, I can say they are very
comfortable. At roughly £6, even if they don't work for you they haven't cost a
fortune.
