This seems to have disappeared from Prime in the last couple of days, but is
available from third parties. It was Â£55 when I bought it on Prime a couple of
days ago.

I wanted to get a speaker that was better than the built in one in our Samsung
TV. I didn't need something with Hi Fi quality, but just significantly better
than the built in speakers. The LG had good reviews, although I think that the
claimed 100W output is probably a decimal point error.

Sound quality is good for TV use and OK for music, but lacking in bass. It has
optical, jack and bluetooth inputs. The latter attracted me as part of my plan
to have a BT speaker in every room in the house. It comes with a remote
control, which was a bit redundant since it worked fine with the TV remote
volume control. It paired with my phone via BT, so I can use it when nobody is
watching the TV. There is an app on the Play Store. However, it failed
completely to work for me and most recent reviewers. However, you don't need an
app anyway!

It's long, so check the dimensions to make sure it will fit on your cabinet
without overhanging the ends.
