Further to Steve's review of walking poles for his Dad. I bought a pair of
these last year for Â£28. I do quite a lot of mountain walking and
climbing. Over the I years have gone through several different expensive
poles. I prefer the flick lock design to the twist to lock, as I find it much
less likely for the sections to slip when you put pressure on them,
particularly when descending. So far these poles have proved robust and are as
good as ones costing a lot more.

These poles are made from carbon fibre and weigh only 190g per pole. They
collapse into a shorter folded length than most other poles. Even if you don't
plod up and down mountains, it's worth paying the small extra amount over the
cheaper poles.
