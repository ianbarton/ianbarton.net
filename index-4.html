Robinson's Squash is a big UK brand of soft drinks, which you dilute with
water. They are usually sold in bottles containing a litre of concentrate.This
is a super concentrated version - the bottle fits into the palm of your
hand. You need much less than a teaspoonful to add to a large glass of
water. There is no added sugar, only what is already part of the fruit.
</p>

<p>
I carry one of these with me in the car, or on my bike. It's easy to find water
and you can make a refreshing drink without lugging a big bottle of juice with
you.

PlanetX Merino Beanie. Price about £8 depending on style. Keeps your head and
ears nice and warm. Fairly water resistant, but not waterproof. As it's made of
Merino you can wear it for months and it will remain odour free. Wash at
30C. Mine survives he washing machine without shrinking, even though it's Merino

These are a "Premium" product and priced accordingly. However, if you search
for "neck warmer", you can find many cheaper clones.
</p>

<p>
The standard Buff is a simple tube made from some sort of stretchable
fabric. If you watch their video, you can see how it can be folded to adapt to
many different situations. In addition to keeping my neck warm, in summer I
fold it into a bandana to operate as a sun hat/sweat band.
</p>

<p>
There are many different patterns/styles. I think we have about six of them in
our family.
</p>

<p>
Note the standard Buff is a simple tube, not the balaclava shown in the link.

<p>
Winter Draws on ("Oh err Missus"), as Frankie Howard would have said. The first
of a few posts about clothing suitable for the outdoors in winter.
</p>

<p>
Disclaimer my Buffalo gear was mostly given to me in the 1980's by Hamish who
owned Buffalo.
</p>

<p>
Yesterday I spent most of the day in the fields in a combination of wind, sleet
and freezing rain. I was really cold and I am someone who doesn't usually
notice the cold. I should have been wearing my Special Six.
</p>

<p>
Buffalo gear has a pertex outer and a pile inner. It is specifically designed
for use in cold wet conditions. It's not waterproof in the conventional
meaning.However, your body heat keeps the inner pile layer dry and the pertex
sheds rain/snow.
</p>

<p>
I have used it a lot in Scottish winters, where you go from freezing rain into
driving snow as you gain altitude. I have never been cold provided I kept
moving. I used it at home a few Christmases ago when it was -18C
outside. Everyone else had about 10 layers on and was shivering. I had Buffalo
salopettes and my special 6 shirt and was warm all day.
</p>

<p>
The gloves are toasty warm, even when wet.
</p>

<p>
The only downside to Buffalo gear is that it is much too hot in tmeperatures
above freezing.

<p>
A very simple way of keeping your dog occupied for at least an hour! The Kong
is hollow, with a hole at each end. You fill it with a mixture of dog food and
biscuits and put it in the freezer. When it's completely frozen just give it to
your dog. The idea is the dog can only get at the food inside the Kong with its
tongue, so it lasts a long time.
</p>

<p>
Our dog normally takes about an hour to completely empty it. The material the
Kong is made from appears to be totally indestructible.  Our dog is capable of
chewing his way through most materials, but the Kong is undamaged after more
than a year.

I used to carry my bike repair kit in one of those wedge bags that fit under
your saddle. However, these get wet and muddy in winter and the contents become
rusty. Also as an n+1 person (number of bikes required is number you have plus
one), I had to try and remember to shift the wedge bag to whatever bike I was
riding. The bags are a bit of a faff to undo and re-connect and sometimes I
would forget.
</p>

<p>
So, now I put my complete repair kit inside an old drinks bottle. This
contains, spare inner tube, CO2 inflator and bottle of CO2, tyre levers, chain
breaker, multi tool, chain quick link. Click on the photo to see what goes in
the bottle.
</p>

<p>
All my bikes have two bottle holders and I hardly ever need to carry two
bottles with drinks in them. Switching the tool kit between bikes only takes a
moment. I pack the bottle with some paper towel, which stops things rattling
and is useful to clean your hand with.

<p>
It's a cast iron beetle for removing wellies. The idea is you wedge the heel of
one boot between the beetles "horns" and stand on its back with the other
foot. You can then pull your foot out of the boot easily.

This gets used in our house several times a day. The one we have used to belong

I am wanting to charge a 12v Leisure battery, which is powering my Raspberry pi
weather station. Depending on which Pi I use, it draws a maximum of 4 Watts.
</p>

<p>
I thought the motorhome and caravan owners on here might have some
recommendations. We already have a unit that is supposed to keep a battery
connected to an electric fencer topped up. It's is almost useless, but I
suspect is down to the power draw from the the fencer.

This is a very geeky item. It's basically an ad-blocker. However, it works at
the periphery of your network, so you don't need to install anything on your
client machines. As you might guess it will run on a RaspberryPi, but it will
also run on just about any architecture.
</p>

<p>
It works by using a blacklist of advertising sites (automatically updated) and
replacing adverts on the web page by a single pixel. It will work with any
mobile device connected to your WiFi without any configuration on the mobile
device.
</p>

<p>
I have installed it on a Linode VPS, together with OpenVPN. This enables me to
use PiHole when I am using 4g. Not only are ads removed, but because this
happens at the server end pages render faster on your device and your data
usage is reduced. Also, as it's a VPN you can use any old dodgy wifi and know
that you are secure.
</p>

<p>
It will work on a PiZero, which costs about a fiver. The instructions on the
web site are pretty good, so installation isn't particularly challenging.
</p>

<p>
There is a nifty web interface which gives stats of the number of ads that have
been blocked and allows you to whitelist sites if you really want to see their
ads.  <a href="https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole">https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole</a>
