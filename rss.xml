I learnt to ride a two wheeled bicycle when I was four and a half. Up until I
got a motorcycle licence I cycled everywhere, as it was the only way of
getting around. There followed a period of about 15 years when I did almost no
cycling. When I was about 30 I bought my first proper road bike with drop
handlebars and derailleur gears. This re-ignited my interest in cycling. I have
never been interested in cycle racing, other than watching it on TV. Almost all
of my cycling is either along, with a family member or a friend.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
After my cancer operation in January 2017 I set myself a target of cycling at
least 100 miles per week to keep fit. I try to avoid cycling in the dark, as I
can't see the scenery. Now I am almost 64 I am much less tolerant of getting
wet, cold and muddy in the winter months. So I decided to by a Smart Trainer,
mainly for use in the winter.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Smart trainers come in many different configurations. However, they all have
the same basic principles. Your remove your back wheel and connect your bike to
a flywheel, which has a cassette that replaces the one attached to your rear
wheel. So you can use your gears as normal, but you will be turning a
flywheel. Most trainers have several built in sensors, which will tell you how
fast you would be moving if you were on the road, the amount of power being
transmitted through the pedals,the cadence (how fast your pedals are rotating)
and possibly your heart rate if you have a heart rate monitor. Most trainers
can connect to external devices either by bluetooth or Ant+.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The Smart part is being able to follow a route using an App connected to the
trainer and the amount of resistance in the flywheel is varied depending on the
angle of the road on your selected route. So the resistance in the pedals feels
exactly as it would if you were actually cycling the route.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
There are a whole range of smartphone/computer apps that you can connect to
your smart trainer. Apps are broadly divided into two categories: dedicated
almost exclusively to training and apps that have Virtual Reality. In fact most
apps have quite a bit of crossover between categories. Two of the most popular
apps are Bkool and Zwift. See the link below on road.cc that gives a list of
almost all available apps.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Most apps will host races that you can participate in. However, my main
interest is simply cycling routes in distant parts of the world without having
to travel there. Bkool has a large library of routes from all over the world,
including all the famous alpine passes and many of the famous World Tour
routes. Most of the popular routes have video, or at least a 3D VR
representation of the route. I Chromecast the route from my phone to a 24"
monitor. Following a route that has video coverage is almost the same as
cycling in reality. You can also upload your own routes.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The majority of smart trainer apps require a monthly subscription, but you can
usually get a months free trial.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
My trainer is permanently setup in the utility room (aka the Pain Cave). At the
moment the temperature inside is about 4C. However, after about 30min cycling I
am soaking wet from the sweat. Unlike cycling on the road there is no wind to
cool you. A good fan is mandatory and plenty of fluid! I usually listen to
podcasts via a bluetooth speaker.
&lt;/p&gt;

My Lenovo P2 has been an excellent phone for the last couple of years. Decent
performance and outstanding battery life. However, I am finding it's 32 GByte of
internal storage a bit limiting. It's stuck on Android 7.0 with a November 2017
security update and has been abandoned by Lenovo. I decided to have a look at
what was available for less than £300.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
After looking at various reviews the Honor 8 with 6.5" screen seemed to fit my
requirements. However, it had a micro usb port, not USBC. I now have several
devices that have USBC ports and buying a new phone with micro USB connector
seemed a bit "Olde school". After a bit more research I discovered the Honor 8
Play. This is basically a souped up version of the Honor 8, supposedly aimed at
gamers.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Specs. include:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
6.3-inch full view display LCD IPS (1080 x 2340)
16MP+2MP dual AI camera
3750mAH  battery supports 1.5 days of heavy usage and includes 9V/2A quick charge
Kirin 970 AI Chipset
64 GByte on board storage with micro/usb dual SIM capability.
USBC connector
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
On Amazon it was priced at £240, well within my budget. Now I am not a gamer,
but I thought paying a bit extra for a phone that had better performance and
USBC was worth it.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Initial setup was a bit unusual. Honor has their own Phone Clone app that did
an excellent job of transferring all my apps and data from the P2. The phone
has a Notch, that bothered me for all of about 5 minutes before I ignored
it. There is a fingerprint scanner on the back and face recognition works
really well, even when I am wearing my beanie and reading glasses.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Honor's UI seemed OK, but as a long time Nova user, I just restored my saved
settings from the P2. The phone is not officially water proof, but the only time this
has been a problem for me was back when I had a Nokia 5800 that was inside the
top pocket of my rucksack and the screen died either from moisture or the cold
in a snow storm. At full brightness you can see the screen OK in bright sun,
but I normally run it at about 20%. The screen aspect ratio makes it easy to
reach either edge of the screen, but as I never use the phone one handed that
doesn't matter to me.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Speaker is OK, but I only use it for listening to phone calls. It does have
the dinosaur 3.5mm jack.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Huawei gives you an awful lot of settings to tinker with, but sometimes this
makes it difficult to find a particular setting buried deep in some menu.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The phone came with Anrdoid 8.0, but immediately updated to 9.0 with November
2018 security patches.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
As it's meant to be a gaming phone, it came with several pre-installed games,
all of which I immediately deleted. There are a couple of other Honor apps that
can be deleted if you want to.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Bluetooth connected to all my headphones and speakers without a problem. The
bluetooth version is 4.2 with AptX HD.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Main camera is 16 MP, f/2.2 with the front camera being 16 MP, f/2.0. Photos
are fine for me.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Battery life - I had no problem getting through a day with more than 50%
available at bed time most days.
&lt;/p&gt;

Plus how to make them run from a usb charger instead of batteries. You need a
couple of 10 ohm resistors and a soldering iron. I am definitely going to try
this. One of those "I did it because I could" projects.
&lt;/p&gt;

When we went to see our eldest daughter at Uni last weekend I noticed that she
had lots of postcard-sized photos on her noticeboard. Prints are "Free" up to
45 6x4 per month, or a total of 500 per year. Other sizes are available if you
pay. There is a delivery charge of £3.99 (ie not totally free), but it seems
reasonable for what you get. You can print directly from Google photos, or
photos on your phone. Quality looked OK to me, but I am not a pixel peeper.

I have had a Brother P Touch label printer for years. I don't think that they
sell my model any longer and I expect you can find a cheaper equivalent to this
one. It's very simple to use and has a built-in cutter and gizmo to separate
the label from the backing tape.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I use it for labeling all sorts of things, such as files and storage
boxes. It's great for labeling wall warts. Most of us have drawers full of
rechargeable electronic items, which come with their own wall wart. If you
don't label the plug it can be almost impossible to work out which plug you
should use to power/recharge a particular bit of electronics.
&lt;/p&gt;

Service Charges in Restaurants.  If I go to a restaurant, rather than a self
service cafe, I can't avoid "Service". It's a non optional part of the
experience. As such the price should be built into the price of the meal. If I
get crap service, I simply won't go back to the same place again.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I don't think any other part of the economy has such a strange idea of selling
you something that includes a service element. If I take my car into the garage
I don't expect to pay an extra 10% because the mechanic did their job properly.
&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>whateverworks</category><guid>https://ianbarton.net/posts/2018-11-15-service-charges-in-restaurants/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 15 Nov 2018 12:08:16 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Duronic Electric Hub</title><link>https://ianbarton.net/posts/2018-11-15-duronic-electric-hub/</link><dc:creator>Ian Barton.</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
A recent problem with our Aga means that we are without heating in the kitchen,
clothes dryer, hot water and the ability to cook anything except by using the
microwave. It will probably be out of action for a week or so while I run some
new copper pipe and move the control box.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The Duronic Electric Hob has two different sized rings and seems reliable so
far. It's easy to clean and powerful enough to heat things rapidly. I think
it's pasta with everything until the Aga is fixed:)
&lt;/p&gt;

A few years ago I tried to hire a couple of Boris Bikes in London with my
son. Despite help from an Official Assistant, we were unable to unlock two
bikes at once. So Boris you owe me £15, which with late payment charges and
interest comes to just over £10,000.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Citibikes in Vienna is much better! There are various apps which show you the
location of all the docking stations and the number of bikes available at each
one. You can do most of the preliminary registration stuff on the
website. However, the final step of registering your debit card requires you to
use one of the card readers at a bike station. Note for Monzo users, just tell
the machine it's a credit card when registering.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Fees are very reasonable. The first hour is free and the second costs
1EU. Vienna is pancake flat with lots of cycle lanes, so even occasional
cyclists should be fine cycling around easy and safe.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
However, the bikes are really heavy. They would probably survive a direct hit
from an anti-tank missile. There is a single front brake, but the main braking
is activated by back pedaling. If you are used to aligning your pedals when you
mount the bike by sticking your foot under a pedal and back pedalling to get
the pedal in the correct position, you can't do this on a Citibike.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
There are three gears. However, the weight of the bike means that even on
slight inclines you have to push hard in the lowest gear.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
If you are a regular cyclist you will find the weight and braking system very
annoying. On my 6.5k ride I averaged about 16kph. On a similar route with my
normal road bike this would have been about 35kph.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
In conclusion good bike for short rides (10-15 minutes) at a very reasonable
price.
&lt;/p&gt;

In a house full of cats and a dog, clothes quickly get covered with various cat
and dog hairs. Lazy people like me just ignore them. However, the female
members of the household are much fussier :) These lint rollers are very
effective at getting off animal hairs from your clothes.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
They come with a roll of "sticky tape" in perforated sections. You tear off a
section and wrap it around the roller. The run the roller over your clothes and
the hairs will automagically stick to it. If you stick a plastic bag over the
roller when you have finished, you can get multiple uses from each sticky tape.
&lt;/p&gt;
